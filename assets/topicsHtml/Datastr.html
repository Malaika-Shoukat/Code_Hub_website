    <h2> What are Data Structures?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>Data Structure</strong> is a way to organize and store data so that it can be used efficiently.
      Data structures allow us to manage large amounts of information effectively, perform operations quickly,
      and improve the performance of programs.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Definition:</strong>  
      A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer
      so that it can be used efficiently for different operations such as searching, sorting, or updating.
    </div>

    <h3> Types of Data Structures</h3>
    <p>Data structures are mainly divided into two categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Primitive Data Structures:</b> Basic data types like integers, floats, and characters.</li>
      <li><b>Non-Primitive Data Structures:</b> More complex types such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and trees.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> Linear Data Structures</h3>
    <p>
      In <b>linear data structures</b>, elements are arranged sequentially, and each element is connected to its previous and next element.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Array</td>
        <td>Stores multiple items of the same type in a contiguous block of memory.</td>
        <td><code>marks = [85, 90, 78, 92]</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Linked List</td>
        <td>Collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.</td>
        <td>Node1 → Node2 → Node3 → NULL</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Stack</td>
        <td>Follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last item added is the first to be removed.</td>
        <td>Example: Stack of plates 🍽️</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Queue</td>
        <td>Follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The first element added is removed first.</td>
        <td>Example: Queue at a ticket counter </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3> Non-Linear Data Structures</h3>
    <p>
      In <b>non-linear data structures</b>, data elements are not stored sequentially.
      They are connected in a hierarchical or network manner.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Tree:</b> Hierarchical structure with a root node and subnodes (like a family tree).</li>
      <li><b>Graph:</b> Set of nodes connected by edges, useful for networks or social connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="diagram">
      Tree Example (Text Diagram):  
      <pre>
              Root
             /   \
          Node1  Node2
           /        \
       Leaf1        Leaf2
      </pre>
    </div>

    <h3> Example Code (Python - Stack)</h3>
    <pre>
# Stack implementation using list
stack = []

# Push elements
stack.append('A')
stack.append('B')
stack.append('C')

print("Initial Stack:", stack)

# Pop element
stack.pop()
print("After Popping:", stack)
    </pre>

    <h3> Why are Data Structures Important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Efficiently organize and manage data.</li>
      <li>Improve program performance and reduce memory usage.</li>
      <li>Used in real-life applications like databases, operating systems, and networking.</li>
      <li>Foundation for advanced subjects like Algorithms, AI, and Machine Learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
       <strong>Tip:</strong> Choosing the right data structure can make your program run much faster and use less memory!
